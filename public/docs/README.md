**AmoxSQL** is a professional, high-performance Local Data IDE built specifically for [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/). Designed for serious data analysts and engineers who need speed, privacy, and advanced tooling without the cloud overhead.

---

## 📜 The Story Behind the Name

Data is the modern form of recorded knowledge. Our project's identity is rooted in this timeless concept from ancient Mesoamerica.

The name **"Amox"** derives from the Nahuatl word ***Amoxtli***, meaning "book" or "codex". These sacred repositories were used by scribes to record history, astronomical calculations, and knowledge.

**AmoxSQL** is the spiritual successor to those ancient tools—a modern, digital codex designed for the data age.

### The Emblem

The glowing glyph representing AmoxSQL symbolizes the fusion of ancient structure and modern energy.

* **The Structure:** The stylized 'A' evokes the architectural precision of an ancient glyph or a structured data schema.
* **The Light:** The electric cyan glow cuts through the dark environment of the IDE, representing the core promise of the tool: **transforming opaque raw data into luminous, clear visualizations.**

## 🚀 Key Features

AmoxSQL is designed for speed, privacy, and a superior developer experience.

### 🧠 Core Workflow & Architecture
* **Project-Centric Workflow**: Organize your work in project folders. The IDE auto-detects existing `.duckdb` or `.db` files upon opening a project.
* **Multi-Tab Architecture**: Work on multiple queries and notebooks simultaneously in a modern tabbed interface.
* **Split View**: Compare code side-by-side or view results alongside your editor.
* **Robust Connection Management**: Implements a "Hard Reset" strategy to ensure clean switching between projects, preventing locked files and "zombie" connections.

### 🤖 AmoxSQL AI (Local & Cloud Intelligence)
*   **100% Offline & Private (Local Mode)**: Powered by a local **Ollama** engine (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder). Your data never leaves your machine.
*   **Cloud Power (Gemini Mode)**: Seamlessly switch to Google's Gemini API for state-of-the-art reasoning with built-in daily free-tier usage tracking to keep you in control.
*   **Integrated Model Management**: Download new local Ollama models directly from within the IDE's unified Settings Modal.
*   **Natural Language to SQL**: Ask questions like *"Show me the top 5 products by sales in 2023"* and get accurate DuckDB SQL instantly.
*   **Smart Context**: The AI understands your current database schema automatically, optimizing prompts to fit within context limits.
*   **Code Generation**: Supports complex JOINs, CTEs, and Window Functions.

### 💾 Database Management & Inspection
*   **Flexible Connection Modes**:
    *   **In-Memory Mode**: For ultra-fast, ephemeral analysis sessions.
    *   **Persistent Connections**: Attach existing DB files in Read-Only or Read/Write mode.
*   **Data Warehouse-Style Table Inspector**:
    *   **Right-Click Details**: Access a full-screen deep dive into any table.
    *   **Schema Tab**: View column types, nullability, and keys.
    *   **Data Profile Tab**: Instant statistical summary using `SUMMARIZE`. Visual Sparklines for Null %, Cardinality (Unique values), and Min/Max distributions.
    *   **Preview Tab**: Paginated view of raw data (Top 200 rows).
    *   **DDL Tab**: View the original `CREATE TABLE` statement.
*   **Intuitive Drag & Drop**: Instantly drag tables or individual columns from the sidebar directly into your SQL Editor.
*   **Instant Table Preview**: Quick "Magnifying Glass" feature to peek at the first 50 rows of any table from the sidebar.
*   **Enhanced Results Table**:
    *   **Global Search**: Filter results instantly across all columns.
    *   **Sorting**: Click column headers to sort ascending/descending.

### 📝 SQL Editing & Notebooks
* **Powerful SQL Editor**: Powered by the **Monaco Editor** (the engine behind VS Code) for a familiar experience with robust auto-completion.
* **SQL Notebooks (`.sqlnb`)**: A Jupyter-like experience for SQL. Combine rich Markdown documentation with executable SQL cells in a single document.
    *   **Presentation Mode**: Switch to "Report View" to hide code cells and display only Markdown text, interactive charts, and data tables.
    *   **PDF Export**: Export your full notebook as a clean, professional PDF report directly from Presentation Mode.
* **Save Queries**: Save your work directly as `.sql` files within your project structure.

### 📊 Data Visualization & IO
* **Instant Visualizations**: Turn query results into charts immediately with an integrated graphing engine (built with Recharts).
    * Supported types: Line, Multi-line, Bar (Horizontal/Vertical), Scatter, and Donut charts.
* **Persistent Chart Configurations (`.amoxvis`)**: Save your advanced visualization designs as `.amoxvis` files directly in your workspace. Edit, load, and keep your charts organized alongside SQL scripts.
* **Advanced Charting Controls**:
    *   **Pivot & Aggregation**: Split series by column, summarize by time (Daily/Monthly/Yearly).
    *   **Customization**: Granular control over colors, line styles, opacity, margins, layout spacing, and data label positioning.
    *   **Axes & Scaling**: Toggle Logarithmic scale, dynamic X/Y bounds, and custom axis titles.
    *   **Reference Indicators**: Add customizable horizontal/vertical reference lines and colored reference areas to highlight targets or thresholds.
    *   **Number Formatting**: Display values in Compact (1.2k), Millions (1.2M), Currency, or Raw formats.
* **High-Quality Export**: Export your charts instantly as high-resolution (up to 4x scale) PNG images.

### 🐛 Advanced Debugging Tools
*   **CTE Debugger**: interactive "Step-Through" for Common Table Expressions. Click the "Play" icon next to any `WITH` clause to inspect intermediate results without rewriting your query.
*   **Query Execution Plan**: Visualize the performance of your SQL.
    *   **Tree Visualization**: Interactive breakdown of query costs.
    *   **Bottleneck Detection**: Automatically highlights high-cost nodes (e.g., expensive Sorts or Scans).
    *   **Split View**: Analyze the plan side-by-side with your code.
* **Seamless Data Import/Export**:
    * **Bulk Import**: Import individual CSV/Parquet files or entire folders directly into DuckDB tables with options for cleaning column names.
    * **Result Export**: Download any query result set as a CSV file.
